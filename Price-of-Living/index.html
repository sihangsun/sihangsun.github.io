                    <p>Considering moving from one big city to another in the U.S.? One of the most important factors to consider is how the cost of living compares to your current location.</p>
                    <p>How much does a pack of Marlboro typically cost in Boston, MA? Which city has the most expensive McMeal? As the most expensive city in the U.S., is everything in New York City overpriced compared to other cities?
                    </p>
                    <p>This interactive tool allows you to look up and compare the prices of 31 goods and services across 30 different U.S. cities. These cities are the top 30 in the economy, measured by their gross domestic product (GDP).
                    </p>
                    <p>The tool provides two ways to compare the cost of living in different cities. While the overall Cost of Living Index offers a quick, aggregated city comparison, the tool's primary focus is on the prices of specific goods and services. This feature allows you to compare items most relevant to your lifestyle, offering a personalized insight into the cost differences between cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>The data used in this project comes from <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/" target="_blank">Numbeo</a>, a crowd-sourced global database of cost of living information.
                    </p>
                    <p>Keep reading on the right to learn how to use the tool, and explore the data visualization tool below.
