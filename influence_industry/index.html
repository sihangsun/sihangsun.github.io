          <p>We use the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign as a case study to attempt to define a basic scope of the Influence Industry by looking into all the data-driven service spending.</p>

          <p>How much of that was spent in data-driven service? By looking into the "disbursement description" data, we were able to identify more than 800 transactions most relevant to data-driven service.</p>

          <p>These transactions can be grouped into 3 spending cateogries.</p>

          <p>Trump campaign's total spending on data service is only $1,168,220 which is a tiny part of the overall cost.</p>
